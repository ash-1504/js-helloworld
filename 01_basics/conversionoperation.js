it will give NAN ie not a number we have to chack carefully while converting */

//if the value is string or undefined then output will be NAN
//if the value is null it will give 0


//if the value is in boolean form like if true then it will give 1 else false it will give 0 
//if we convert 
// 1 = true
//0 = false
//"" = false
//"aastha"= true

//output will give 33 but its type will show string
